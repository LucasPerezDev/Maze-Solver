# Maze Solver API Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Maze Solver API, detailing the classes and methods used in the project. The classes are designed to load a maze from a file, solve it using various pathfinding algorithms, and visualize the solution.

## Class: `Maze`

### Description
The `Maze` class provides functionality to load, validate, and print a maze from a text file. The maze must have exactly one start point ('A') and one goal point ('B'). The maze layout is represented by a 2D list where walls are marked as `True` and open paths are marked as `False`.

### Attributes

- **`start` (tuple)**: Coordinates of the start point `(row, column)`.
- **`goal` (tuple)**: Coordinates of the goal point `(row, column)`.
- **`height` (int)**: The number of rows in the maze.
- **`width` (int)**: The number of columns in the maze.
- **`walls` (list)**: A 2D list representing the maze layout. Each element is `True` for a wall and `False` for an open path.
- **`solution` (list)**: A list containing two lists, one for the actions to reach the goal and one for the cells visited on the solution path.

### Methods

#### `__init__(filename)`
```python
def __init__(self, filename)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `filename` (str): Path to the maze file.
- **Description**: 
  - Reads the contents of the maze file.
  - Validates that the file contains exactly one start point ('A') and one goal point ('B').
  - Determines the maze's dimensions (`height` and `width`).
  - Constructs a 2D list `walls` to represent the maze.
- **Raises**:
  - `Exception`: If the maze file does not contain exactly one start point ('A') and one goal point ('B').
  - `FileNotFoundError`: If the maze file does not exist.
  - `ValueError`: If the maze file contains invalid characters or malformed lines.

#### `print()`
```python
def print(self)
```
- **Description**: 
  - Prints the maze to the console in a human-readable format.
  - The start point is marked with 'A', the goal point with 'B', walls with 'â–ˆ', and open paths with spaces (' ').
  - If a solution exists, the solution path will be printed, with the start and goal points displayed.
- **Returns**:
  - `None`

#### `neighbors(state)`
```python
def neighbors(self, state)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `state` (tuple): A tuple representing the current state `(row, column)`.
  
- **Returns**:
  - A list of tuples, each representing a valid neighbor (up, down, left, right) of the current state.
  - If a neighboring cell is a wall, it is not included in the list.
  
- **Description**:
  - For each direction (up, down, left, right), it checks if the neighboring cell is within the bounds of the maze and if it's an open path (not a wall).

## Class: `Solver`

#### `solve()`
```python
def solve(self)
```
- **Description**:
  - Solves the maze using a search algorithm.
  - Tracks the path taken from the start to the goal and saves the solution in `self.solution`.
  - If no solution is found, raises an exception.
  
- **Returns**:
  - `None` if the solution is found, and the solution is stored in `self.solution`.

## Class: `Node`

- **`parent` (Node or None)**: The parent node from which this node was reached, or `None` if it is the root node (start point).
- **`action` (str or None)**: The action taken to reach the current state. This can be `None` for the root node or a string representing the move (e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right').
- **`g` (float)**: The cost from the start node to this node.
- **`h` (float)**: The heuristic cost estimate from this node to the goal.
