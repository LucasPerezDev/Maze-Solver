# Maze Solver Architecture

## Overview
The Maze Solver project is designed to load, validate, and solve mazes using various pathfinding algorithms. It consists of multiple components working together to provide a solution to the maze problem. This document outlines the architecture of the system, explaining the various components and how they interact.

## Project Structure

### 1. `maze_solver/`
This is the main directory where the core program logic is located.
- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the application. It orchestrates the loading of the maze, the selection of the pathfinding algorithm, and outputs the results.
- **`maze.py`**: Contains the `Maze` class which is responsible for reading and representing the maze structure. It also includes methods to validate the maze and print it to the console.
- **`search.py`**: Defines the `Solver` class and the pathfinding algorithms used to solve the maze.
- **`frontier.py`**: Contains the `Frontier`, `StackFrontier`, and `QueueFrontier` classes, which manage the frontier used in the search algorithms.
- **`node.py`**: Defines the `Node` class, which represents a state in the maze and holds the parent node and action.
- **`Visualizer`**: Contains the `MazeVisualizer` class, which is responsible for drawing the maze, highlighting the solution path, and visualizing the exploration process.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions, such as the heuristic function for the A* algorithm.

### 2. `data/`
This directory contains maze data files (`.txt` format) that are used to test the solver. Each file represents a different maze layout.
- **`maze1.txt`, `maze2.txt`, ...**: Example maze files that will be used for testing the pathfinding algorithms.

### 3. `docs/`
This directory contains documentation for the project, including technical details, API documentation, and design decisions.
- **`API.md`**: Describes the public API, including classes and methods exposed by the project.
- **`architecture.md`**: This document, outlining the overall architecture and design decisions.

### 4. `images/`
This directory stores images generated by the `MazeVisualizer` class. These images show the maze and its solution, as well as any explored cells.
- **`maze.png`**: An example image showing the maze with the explored path and solution.

## Components

### 1. `Maze Class`
The `Maze` class is the central part of the application. It is responsible for:
- **Loading the maze** from a text file.
- **Validating the maze** to ensure it has one start point ('A') and one goal point ('B').
- **Representing the maze** as a 2D list of walls and open spaces.
- **Printing the maze** to the console.

### 2. Pathfinding Algorithms
In the future, different pathfinding algorithms (such as DFS, BFS, and A*) will be added to solve the maze. The `main.py` will handle the execution of these algorithms. Currently, the project supports:
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: A search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A search algorithm that explores all possible paths level by level.
- **A* Search (A*)**: A heuristic-based search algorithm that combines the cost to reach the node (g) and the estimated cost to the goal (h) to prioritize nodes.

### 3. Utility Functions
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that assist in the pathfinding process. Currently, it includes:
- **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic function used in the A* algorithm to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal.

### 4. Main Flow (In `main.py`)
- **Maze Initialization**: The program begins by loading the maze from a file.
- **Pathfinding Execution**: The program will then run one of the pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path from the start point ('A') to the goal ('B').
- **Output**: Once a solution is found, it will be displayed in the console. The program will also generate a graphical representation of the maze and its solution, which is saved as an image file.

## Data Flow

1. **Input (Maze Data)**: The maze is loaded from a text file located in the `data/` directory.
2. **Processing**:
   - The `Maze` class loads and parses the maze file.
   - Pathfinding algorithms will take over, exploring the maze to find a path from start ('A') to goal ('B').
3. **Output (Maze Solution)**: 
   - The solution is displayed in the console, where the path is marked.
   - The maze, along with the explored cells and solution path, is visualized and saved as a PNG image in the images/ directory.

## Future Enhancements
- **GUI**: A graphical user interface could be added for interactive maze-solving.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the Maze Solver project is modular, allowing for the easy addition of new features, such as more algorithms or graphical output. The current system is based on a command-line interface, but future versions may include additional functionality for better user experience.
