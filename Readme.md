# Maze Solver Project

## Description
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm to solve different mazes. The goal is to create an efficient solution for solving mazes of varying sizes.

## Objectives
- **Short-term Goals**: Implement DFS and BFS algorithms.
- **Long-term Goals**: Generate a PNG representation of the solution and implement the A* algorithm.

## Project Structure
```
Maze-solver-methods/
 │── maze_solver/ 
 │ ├── main.py # Entry point of the program 
 │ ├── maze.py # Maze class for reading and displaying the maze 
 │── data/ # Directory for maze data files (e.g., maze1.txt) 
 │── docs/ # Project documentation (e.g., API.md)
```
## Usage
To run the project, execute:
```bash
python .\maze_solver\main.py .\data\maze_example.txt
```

 Make sure you have a valid maze file inside the ```data/``` folder.
